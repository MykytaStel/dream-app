## Status

Latest shipped version: `0.0.25`
Current release target: `0.1.0`

This release turns the app from a local-first MVP into a first public-quality
beta focused on an ultra-fast wake flow, an intimate private feeling, and
stylized reflection through voice, transcript, and recurring dream patterns. See
